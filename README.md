# üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Hacking Labs & Projects

This repository contains a collection of ethical hacking labs, performance assessments, and guided practices completed during my cybersecurity coursework. These exercises simulate real-world offensive security tasks including reconnaissance, exploitation, post-exploitation, and defense evasion. All activities were performed in isolated lab environments using tools such as ParrotOS, Metasploit, Wireshark, Nmap, and Aircrack-ng.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: These projects were conducted for educational purposes in controlled environments. The techniques demonstrated should not be used on unauthorized systems.
